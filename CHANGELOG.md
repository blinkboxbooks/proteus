# Change log

## 0.2.0 ([#7](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Deployment/proteus/pull/7) 2014-05-20 13:50:10)

Allow breaking changes in v0

#### New features

- When the current version is `0.y.z` then text indicating incompatible changes increments the `minor` rather than `major` version, as incompatible changes are expected in v0 products and you can make incompatible changes in v0 according to the semantic versioning policy.

## 0.1.3 ([#6](https://git.mobcastdev.com/Deployment/proteus/pull/6) 2014-05-20 11:36:52)

Allow the improvement keyword

### Improvement

- Patch to add the "improvement" keyword, it will be recognised as a PATCH version bump.

Falsely detecting changes to CHANGELOG & VERSION
